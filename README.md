Project Description  
Welcome to Wacky Web, where logic takes a vacation and chaos runs the show. This isn’t your typical website. It’s a digital rabbit hole of unpredictable games, pixelated panic, and lots of "Wait, what just happened?!"  

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and a little sprinkle of humour), Wacky Web is a collection of three games that are really simple… but are they??  

The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
There are a bunch of serious games and apps on the web. But sometimes we might think "Why not give a crazy twist to all those serious stuffs!!"  
Wacky Web is what happens when a developer chooses chaos over convention.  
Why make things useful, when you can make them hilariously confusing?  

The Solution (that nobody asked for)   
In a world full of polished apps and purposeful projects, we proudly present…Wacky Web — the solution to a problem nobody had, crafted with way too much enthusiasm.   
And rightly as Joker said "Why so serious?"
